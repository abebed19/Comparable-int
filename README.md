# Comparable-int

The Comparable interface defines the compareTo method used to compare objects. If a class implements the Comparable interface, objects created from that class can be sorted using Java's sorting algorithms.

The compareTo method required by the Comparable interface receives as its parameter the object to which the "this" object is compared. If the "this" object comes before the object received as a parameter in terms of sorting order, the method should return a negative number. If, on the other hand, the "this" object comes after the object received as a parameter, the method should return a positive number. Otherwise, 0 is returned. The sorting resulting from the compareTo method is called natural ordering.

Let's take a look at this with the help of a Member class that represents a child or youth who belongs to a club. Each club member has a name and height. The club members should go to eat in order of height, so the Member class should implement the Comparable interface. The Comparable interface takes as its type parameter the class that is the subject of the comparison. We'll use the same Member class as the type parameter.

public class Member implements Comparable<Member> {
    private String name;
    private int height;

    public Member(String name, int height) {
        this.name = name;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    public int getHeight() {
        return this.height;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return this.getName() + " (" + this.getHeight() + ")";
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Member member) {
        if (this.height == member.getHeight()) {
            return 0;
        } else if (this.height > member.getHeight()) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return -1;
        }
    }
}
The compareTo method required by the interface returns an integer that informs us of the order of comparison.

As returning a negative number from compareTo() is enough if the this object is smaller than the parameter object, and returning zero is sufficient when the lengths are the same, the compareTo method described above can also be implemented as follows.

@Override
public int compareTo(Member member) {
    return this.height - member.getHeight();
}
Since the Member class implements the Comparable interface, it is possible to sort the list by using the sorted method. In fact, objects of any class that implement the Comparable interface can be sorted using the sorted method. Be aware, however, that a stream does not sort the original list - only the items in the stream are sorted.

If a programmer wants to organize the original list, the sort method of the Collections class should be used. This, of course, assumes that the objects on the list implement the Comparable interface.

Sorting club members is straightforward now.

List<Member> member = new ArrayList<>();
member.add(new Member("mikael", 182));
member.add(new Member("matti", 187));
member.add(new Member("ada", 184));

member.stream().forEach(m -> System.out.println(m));
System.out.println();
// sorting the stream that is to be printed using the sorted method
member.stream().sorted().forEach(m -> System.out.println(m));
member.stream().forEach(m -> System.out.println(m));
// sorting a list with the sort-method of the Collections class
Collections.sort(member);
member.stream().forEach(m -> System.out.println(m));
Sample output
mikael (182)
matti (187)
ada (184)

mikael (182)
ada (184)
matti (187)

mikael (182)
matti (187)
ada (184)

mikael (182)
ada (184)
matti (187)
